To add updates from your local repository to the remote repository, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you are in the root directory of your local Git repository. You can use the `cd` command as you mentioned to navigate to the correct directory:

   ```shell
   cd C:/Users/FAHIM/Star-Maps-101-and-Practices
   ```

2. Check the status of your local repository to see if there are any changes that need to be committed. Use the following command:

   ```shell
   git status
   ```

3. If you have made changes and want to include them in the update, add and commit the changes. For example, if you want to add all changes, use:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

   Replace `"Your commit message"` with a brief description of the changes you made.

4. If you've already committed changes, you can skip the commit step.

5. Next, pull any new changes from the remote repository to ensure your local repository is up-to-date before pushing your changes:

   ```shell
   git pull origin master
   ```

   This command fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repository into your local `master` branch.

6. If there are any conflicts between your changes and the remote changes, resolve them as described in the previous responses.

7. Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```shell
   git push origin master
   ```

   This command pushes your local commits to the remote `master` branch.

Now, your updates should be added to the remote repository. Keep in mind that you may need to replace `master` with the appropriate branch name if you are using a different branch.
