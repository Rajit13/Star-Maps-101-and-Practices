This practice book is dedicated to all Astronomy enthusiasts and those aiming for cracking Star Charts part of Astronomy and Earth Science Olympiads. It is not a full star atlas but it will fulfill its duty as a practice book. I'll recommend students to \textbf{Print} it then solve problems. Keep it during your exam days as \textbf{only printed materials} are allowed in IOAA. \\

\textit{Written from my experience of both being a participant of two international Olympiads as well as team leader for IOAA since 2018. I've also tried to mix my added experience as a stargazer/amateur astronomer into it!}\\

\begin{abstract}
{\color{blue} This book delves into the fundamental knowledge necessary for computations associated with studying the sky and the positions of celestial objects, specifically in observational astronomy—focusing on naked-eye observation. It elucidates practical examples that progressively increase in complexity. Initially, memorizing all the constellations might seem daunting for enhanced observational skills. However, contrary to this belief, memorization isn't required. Instead, this book systematically guides you in understanding the sky, allowing you to approach challenges as if solving a puzzle.}

\section{Stars, Constellations, and Olympiads}
 
If you are aiming for Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad\footnote{IOAA/IAO} or even Earth Science Olympiad\footnote{IESO} you may find a section  where problems contains a star map. So what is a star chart i.e. Sky Map?\\

But before that, you should know some basic concepts i.e. what are Constellations? How stars move across the sky or it affects our observation? \\

\textbf{Constellations} represent apparent patterns formed by stars in the sky, often resembling figures or shapes perceived by humans. For instance, constellations might create recognizable figures like a Man (You may already guess the specific constellation I'm referring to!). They aid in identifying and recalling specific portions of the sky. However, it's important to note that creating random figures or personalized constellations is not officially recognized in Olympiads or by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU has officially acknowledged 88 constellations, while other popular patterns that are not part of these recognized constellations are referred to as Asterisms (e.g., Summer Triangle, Heavenly G, Big Dipper).\\

In a sky map, constellations are organized as their apparent orientation (projections) in the sky with respect to other celestial objects. In Olympiads question setters provides a sky map of a certain region (latitude $\phi$) and ask students to determine some things or identify objects or constellation. Basics of Celestial Coordinate system is needed to understand the maps as well as solve the problems.

\subsection{Constellation Names}

Each Latin constellation name has two forms: the nominative, for use when talking about the constellation itself, and the genitive, or possessive, which is used in star names. For instance, Hamal, the brightest star in the constellation Aries (nominative form), is also called Alpha Arietis (genitive form), meaning literally, ``the alpha of Aries".\\

All modern constellations were codified in the European scientific subculture prior to the 19th century. As Latin was the international language of science up to that time, Latin governs the pronunciation of constellation names.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/connames.html}} The Latin names of all the constellations, their abbreviated names and boundaries can be found in the table below. They are a mix of the ancient Greek patterns recorded by Ptolemy as well as some more ``modern" patterns observed later by more modern astronomers.\\

The IAU\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/}} adopted three-letter abbreviations of the constellation names at its inaugural General Assembly in Rome in 1922. The abbreviations devised by the IAU each have three letters which in the majority of cases are the first three letters of the constellation name, such as AND for Andromeda, EQU for Equuleus, HER for Hercules, ORI for Orion and so on. This trend is not strictly adhered to in cases where confusion may arise. This happens with the two constellations Leo (abbreviated LEO) and Leo Minor (abbreviated LMI). Similarly, because Triangulum (TRI) may be mistaken for Triangulum Australe, the latter is abbreviated TRA. Other instances occur with Sagitta (SGE) and Sagittarius (SGR) and with Canis Major (CMA) and Canis Minor (CMI) where the first two letters from the second names of the constellations are used. This is also the case with Corona Australis (CRA) and Corona Borealis (CRB) where the first letter of the second name of each constellation is incorporated. Finally, mention must be made of Crater (CRT) which has been abbreviated in such a way as to avoid confusion with the aforementioned CRA (Corona Australis).\\

In Olympiads, students are allowed to use star or constellation names based on their system, yet obtaining permission is necessary for IOAA/IAO/APAO/OWAO competitions. Typically, team leaders should inquire about this with the host jury. Therefore, students from countries like Bangladesh are advised to consistently utilize names designated by the IAU. However, for a comprehensive understanding of the Bangla names of stars and constellations, along with their background stories, students are encouraged to read the book {\color{blue}``\textbf{Tara Porichity} by Abdul Jobbar''}.\\

\textbf{Learning how to recognize constellations}

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\itemsep0em 
	\item Write down the list of all the constellations you want to remember (let's call this to be ``C-List")
	\item Open the Stellarium app\footnote{Download from: \url{https://stellarium.org/}},
	\item Turn the constellation lines on, and the constellation names on.
	\item Find all the constellation from the ``C-list," try to remember where they are situated and how they look
	\item Turn the constellation names off (leave only the constellation lines on).
	\item Try to find all the constellations from the ``C-List" without the ``Search" function. If you can find the constellation, you strike it out of the ``C-list." If not, find it with the ``Search" function, try to remember where it is situated and how it looks.
	\item Then, repeat all the previous steps with all the constellations left after the first striking-out. If you can find the constellation you strike it out of the ``C-list". If not, find it with the "Search" function, try to remember where it is situated and how it looks
	\item Repeat the striking-out rounds until you have no constellations left in your ``C-list."
	\item If you every day repeat steps 1-8 (each day you start with blank ``C-list" with no constellations struck out), just in 4-5 days you will be able to recognize the constellations lines and will have the basic knowledge about how they are situated on the night sky.
	\item When you can strike all the constellations from the ``C-list" in one striking out round, you can start repeating all the previous steps, but now with constellation lines turned off. If you repeat these steps every day, just in some days you will get good skills of determining the position of the constellation, and recognizing it by its picture or stars around.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Star Names}

Most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names by the German astronomer Johann Bayer in 1603, in his star atlas \textit{Uranometria}. Bayer assigned a lowercase Greek letter, such as alpha ($\alpha$), beta ($\beta$), gamma ($\gamma$), etc., to each star he catalogued, combined with the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in genitive (possessive) form. (See 88 modern constellations for the genitive forms later on the table.) For example, Aldebaran is designated $\alpha$ Tauri (pronounced Alpha Tauri), which means ``Alpha of the constellation Taurus".\\

A constellation’s most brilliant star is often called Alpha, the first letter in the Greek alphabet. The letters are used with the Latin genitive form of the constellation name, so the Alpha star of Centaurus is called “Alpha Centauri.” But there are few exceptions. For example, Gemini’s brightest star is $\beta$ and that of octans is $\nu$. Here is the lowercase Greek alphabet as used by astronomers:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}$\alpha$ Alpha\\ $\beta$ Beta\\ $\gamma$ Gamma\\ $\delta$ Delta\\ $\varepsilon$ Epsilon\\ $\zeta$ Zeta\\ $\eta$ Eta\\ $\theta$ Theta\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}$\iota$ Iota\\ $\kappa$ Kappa\\ $\lambda$ Lambda\\ $\mu$ Mu\\ $\nu$ Nu\\ $\xi$ Xi\\ o Omicron\\ $\pi$ Pi\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}$\rho$ Rho\\ $\sigma$ Sigma\\ $\tau$ Tau\\ $\upsilon$ Upsilon\\ $\phi$ Phi\\ $\chi$ Chi\\ $\Psi$ Psi\\ $\omega$ Omega\end{tabular}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


In Olympiad questions, when asked about a star’s name examiners and Jury prefer these Greek letter titles (Flamsteed or Bayer Designation) rather than actual popular name. So it is a wise decision to remember star names by Greek letters.\\

A student should always know which star is the $\alpha$, $\beta$ star for a certain constellation. Specially exceptions. Sometimes you may have to remember special stars designated $\gamma$ or $\zeta$ etc.\\

\textbf{Knowing where the brightest constellation stars are situated}\\

For learning where they are on the night sky, you can use the plan similar to the one for learning the constellations:
You can learn their position with the same plan

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item  Write down the list of all the stars you want to remember (let's call this to be ``S-List")
	\item Open the Stellarium app, try to find a star without turning the names and lines of the constellations on. If you managed to strike it out of the ``S-List."
	\item If not, turn on the constellation lines and try to find the star again. If you managed to find it, leave the star in the list without striking it out.
	\item If not, find the star with the ``Search" function, try to remember where it is situated and how it looks. Don't strike it out.
	\item  Repeat the striking-out rounds until you have no stars left in your ``S-list."
\end{enumerate}

If you every day repeat steps 1-5 (each day you start with blank ``S-list" with no stars struck), just in a week, you will be able to recognize the stars on the night sky. You will also have a good knowledge of the relative positions of the constellations.

\subsection{Constellation Figures}

In star maps it is common to mark line “patterns” that represent the shapes that give the name to the constellations. However, the IAU defines a constellation by its boundary (indicated by sky coordinates) and not by its pattern and the same constellation may have several variants in its representation.\\

The constellations should be differentiated from asterisms. Asterisms are patterns or shapes of stars that are not related to the known constellations, but nonetheless are widely recognized by laypeople or in the amateur astronomy community. Examples of asterisms include the seven bright stars in Ursa Major known as “the Plough” in Europe or “the Big Dipper” in America, as well as “the Summer Triangle”, a large triangle, seen in the summer night sky in the northern hemisphere and composed of the bright stars Altair, Deneb and Vega. Whilst a grouping of stars may be officially designated a constellation by the IAU, this does not mean that the stars in that constellation are necessarily grouped together in space. Sometimes stars will be physically close to each other, like the Pleiades, but constellations are generally really a matter of perspective. They are simply our Earth-based interpretation of two dimensional star patterns on the sky made up of stars of many differing brightnesses and distances from Earth.\\

In the next page you'll find the official figures from IAU. Notice that you should \textbf{only} remember constellation figures from IAU. You'll find many shapes of same constellation on the internet which might differ due to distortion or variable conditions on their observations.

\section{Exploring the Moon}
The Moon is by far the most rewarding celestial object for a small telescope. Even a very small instrument will reveal its bleak, blasted landscape of mountain ranges, plains, hills, valleys, and craters. Even binoculars show many features, and there are enough interesting sites on the Moon to keep a telescopic explorer busy forever.



\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{moon1.png}
\end{figure}
You'll notice right away that except when the Moon is full, it is divided by the terminator, the line separating lunar day and night. Here is where detail shows best. When the Moon is a waxing (growing) crescent, we see the parts on the right edge of the map. At first-quarter phase we see the entire right half, and so on. To use this lunar map, turn the chart until it matches your view. Note: Some telescopes give a mirror image, which will not match this map no matter how you turn it.\\

Refractors and Cassegrain reflectors give mirror images when used with a star diagonal; so does any other instrument containing an odd number of mirrors. If you find this to be a problem, take out the star diagonal and view ``straight through." A correct image is much easier to compare with any map.\\

Once the map is oriented, it will be simple to identify the major craters, mountains, and other features. In time, the geography of this alien world will become as familiar to you as that of our own.

\subsection{Moon's motion}

The Moon's orbital plane has an inclination of $5^\circ9'$ in relation to the ecliptic. Although this angle remains approximately constant, the orbital plane is not fixed, moving such that its axis describes a complete circle around of the ecliptic axis in a period of 18.6 years.\\

Therefore, in relation to the Celestial Equator, the Moon's orbit has an inclination that varies from $18.4^\circ(23.5^\circ - 5.15^\circ$) to $28.7^\circ(23.5^\circ + 5.15^\circ$).\\

Per day, the Moon moves $\dfrac{360^\circ}{27.3 \;\rm days} \approx 13^\circ$ east in relation to the stars. This movement is a reflection of the Moon's revolution around the Earth, which completes every 27.3 days (sidereal month). The Sun moves $\approx 1^\circ$ east per day, therefore the Moon is $\approx 12^\circ$ east of the Sun per day. Because of this, the Moon crosses the local meridian $12^\circ$ . $\dfrac{4 \;\rm min}{1^\circ} \approx 50$ min later than the previous day.

\subsection{Moon's Phase}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
From the diagram, $\angle SME= \Psi$ and $MN= CM \cos \measuredangle CMN=r\cos (90^\circ- \measuredangle CME)=r\cos [90^\circ-(90^\circ-\measuredangle SME)]= r \cos \Psi$. So here $\phi$ is phase of the moon, which is the ratio between illuminated part of lunar disk and total visible disk.।
\[\boxed{0 \leq \phi \leq 1}\] 	
\begin{align}
	\phi &=\frac{BN}{AB}=\frac{r+MN}{2r}=\frac{r+r\cos\Psi}{2r} \nonumber \\
	\phi&= \frac{1+\cos\Psi}{2}\\
	&=\frac{\sin^2\frac{\Psi}{2}+\cos^2\frac{\Psi}{2}+ \cos^2\frac{\Psi}{2}-\sin^2\frac{\Psi}{2}}{2}\nonumber\\
	\phi&=\cos^2 \frac{\Psi}{2} \label{lunareqq}

\section{Deep Sky Objects}

\textbf{Deep Sky Objects} shortly DSOs are another interesting element of night sky observation as well as Observation round. Deep sky objects can galaxies, star clusters both open and globular or nebula. It is important to know which what and their perspective position in sky. So it is no wonder that someone has already classified these objects in night sky. The one classification now Astronomers widely follow is done by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles (Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters). Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them. The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as the Messier catalogue. This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier number. You can find 3 kinds of catalogue  on the star map-- Messier Catalogue (M), New General Catalogue (NGC), Index Catalogue (IC)\\

For Olympiad a student must know the position and type of some DSOs. Here are some of these that I recommend---\\

It is not customary to also remember how a particular DSO looks. But for the fascination of these and to know the structure, some examples should be remembered which are very popular. For instance, Andromeda galaxy, Pleiades or Ring Nebula. In the \nth{12}, 2018 and nth{15}, 2022 IOAA recognizing DSOs by their image was a controversial question. So I'll suggest, \textit{Be safe than sorry}!

\textbf{Some key facts about Messier Objects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only 34 out of 88 constellations contain Messier Objects
    \item Sagittarius contains the most about 35 where Virgo have 11, Coma Berenices have 8, Ursa Major and Ophiachus with 7 each, Canes Venatici and Leo contains 5 each, and Scorpius contains 4.
    \item The list of 109 objects compiled by C. Messier contains many of the fines deep sky objects however observed from Paris. So far southern sky was lost to him. That's why 62 of his objects lie in these 8 constellations, famously known as Messier Northern Bias.

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{43em}
For data related to the problems below refer to the Messier Object List table. 
\end{minipage}}\\


\textsf{\textbf{Question 1}} The latitude of the location is $60^\circ$ N. Questions 1.1 to 1.4 refer to the same location, but may not refer to the sky on the same day/night. \\

\textbf{Object of consideration:} Butterfly Cluster (M6), Trifid Nebula (M20), Wild Duck Cluster (M11), Ring Nebula (M57), Albireo, Arcturus, Rasalhague, M3.\\

1.1 \textbf{Which object/star cannot be seen at this location at any time of the year?}
\begin{sol}
    -- M6 as You cannot see any object below $-30^\circ$ declination.
\end{sol}

    
1.2  \textbf{Which object below cannot be seen on the night of the vernal equinox at midnight?}
\begin{sol}
    -- Wild Duck Cluster (M11), At midnight of the Vernal Equinox, the meridian is 12h. As such, any object within 6h to 18h will not be able to be seen. That is apart from those that are circumpolar.	
\end{sol}

    
1.3 \textbf{If M3 is currently at the local meridian, in how many hours will Albireo set?}

\begin{sol}
    -- If M3 is at the local Meridian, then Albeiro would be just rising. As such, it will set in 12 hours.
\end{sol}

    
1.4 \textbf{Which object will be closest to the zenith when it culminates on the local meridian?}

\begin{sol}
	  -- Ring Nebula (M57), We look for the item with the declination is the closest to +60◦, which is local zenith at that location.
\end{sol}
  
    
\textsf{\textbf{Question 2}}  A deep-sky object located directly at the celestial equator with an angular diameter of $10'$ is viewed from the eyepiece of a telescope with a true field of view of $0.8^\circ$. Object tracking on the telescope is disabled and the object is aligned at the edge of the field of view. Assuming the object moves along the diameter of the eyepiece before disappearing, calculate the time it takes for the object to drift out of view of the eyepiece.

\begin{sol}
-- Objects on the Celestial Equator in the sky rotate once every sidereal day, that is, $360^\circ$ in $23^h56^m4.1^s$. This gives $0.251^\circ$/min. The time it takes to drift out of the eyepiece is thus--

\[\frac{0.8^\circ}{0.251^\circ/\rm min}=3.19\; \rm min\]	
\end{sol}

\textsf{\textbf{Question 3}} Imagine that you are in a post-COVID world without travel restrictions and are currently on a stargazing trip in a remote location at a latitude of $35^\circ$ N. Capella (RA/DE: 5h 18m / +46 deg 01min) is currently 3 degrees above the western horizon. The following table shows a list of DSOs you have decided to try to observe for tonight. \\

\textbf{Object of consideration:} Heart Nebula, Omega Centauri, Black-Eye Galaxy, Dumbbell Nebula. \\

\textbf{In what order, from highest to lowest priority, should you arrange your observations so as to maximise your chances of seeing every one of the DSOs on your list?}

\begin{sol}
    -- Omega Centauri, Black Eye Galaxy, Dumbbell Nebula, Heart Nebula\\
    
    A quick calculation ($90^\circ-61^\circ= 29^\circ$) shows us that the Heart Nebula is circumpolar and thus has lower priority. Ideally, one would want to view it when it is near the meridian, and judging by the RA (which is earlier than Capella), it is around its lower culmination. The Dumbbell Nebula has a RA of 20h, indicating that it is on the eastern side of the sky and thus would have lower priority. Between Omega Centauri and the Black Eye Galaxy, the latter has a slightly earlier RA and thus is normally prioritized if we are near the equator. However, at northern latitudes, objects with more southern declinations spend less time above the horizon and thus set faster. While we normally need spherical trigonometry to ascertain which objects set earlier, there is a very small difference in RA between Omega Centauri and Black Eye Galaxy (31 minutes). Omega Centauri will set earlier and thus should be prioritized. (Note: Omega Centauri is very barely visible.)
\end{sol}
 
 
\textsf{\textbf{Question 4}} \textbf{Object of consideration:} Triangulum Galaxy, Andromeda Galaxy, Orion Nebula, Dumbbell Nebula and Eskimo Nebula where it has apparent magnitude of 10.1 and apparent size of $0.8\times 0.8$. \\ 

\textbf{Calculate the surface brightness of each DSO in $\rm mag/arcsec^2$, and hence arrange them in order of increasing surface brightness.} 

\begin{sol}
-- Triangulum Galaxy, Andromeda Galaxy, Orion Nebula, Dumbbell nebula, Eskimo
Nebula.\\
The calculated surface brightness of the objects are\\
• Triangulum: 23.3\\
• Andromeda: 22.5\\
• Orion: 21.87\\
• Dumbbell: 20.6\\
• Eskimo: 18.5	
\end{sol}


\fbox{\begin{minipage}{43em}
$^{\color{red} \ast}$\textbf{Surface Brightness:} The total luminosity emitted by a column of linear area $dA =\Omega r^2$. Generally presented as,
$$\Sigma \approx \frac{F}{\Omega} \approx \frac{L}{4\pi d^2 \, \pi (R/d)^2} \approx \frac{L}{4\pi^2 R^2}; \quad \;\rm Unit:  Wm^{-2}ster^{-1}$$  
Surface Magnitude: Logarithmic form of Surface brightness, generally presented as, 
$$\mu = -2.5\, \log\, \Sigma +C$$
Just like any other magnitude term you can't easily multiply, add or subtract $\mu$. The unit of $\mu$ is $\rm mag/arcsec^2$. To understand this suppose a star has a surface magnitude of $13\, \rm mag/arcsec^2$, it is actually comparable to a star with angular area of $1\, \rm arcsec^2$ to seem to have an apparent magnitude of $13^m$.
\end{minipage}}
\vspace{0.5 cm}

\textsf{\textbf{Question 5}} You are given a list of the following planetary nebulae for an upcoming observation session near the Equator. \\

\textbf{Object of consideration:} M27 (Dumbbell Nebula), M57 (Ring Nebula), M76 (Little Dumbbell Nebula), M97 (Owl Nebula), C39 (Eskimo Nebula), C63 (Helix Nebula).\\

\textbf{What are planetary nebulae? Briefly describe how they are formed.}
\begin{sol}
-- They are emission nebulae surrounding the cores of old red giants. As these stars exhaust their fuel, the core contracts under its own gravity, increasing its temperature and
increasing the luminosity. These conditions cause the red giant star to lose most of its outer layers to space, which are subsequently ionised by the hot remnant core/white dwarf to form these planetary nebulae.	
\end{sol}

\textbf{A proper observation plan should be sorted by the time objects rise. Sort the objects in this list by the order in which they rise, with the earliest object first.}
\begin{sol}
-- M76 $\rightarrow$ C39 $\rightarrow$ M97 $\rightarrow$ M57 $\rightarrow$ M27 $\rightarrow$ C63	
\end{sol}

\textbf{Suppose that during one night, you notice that the Owl Nebula is
setting. Other than the Owl Nebula, what objects are above the
horizon right now?}
\begin{sol}
-- M57, M27, C63.	
\end{sol}

\textsf{\textbf{Question 6}} \textbf{In a mildly light-polluted night sky with a surface brightness of $19.4\; \rm mag/arcsec^2$, which of the above objects are visible with the naked eye}.
\begin{sol}
	-- Orion Nebula and Andromeda Galaxy,\\
	
	Dumbbell Nebula and Eskimo Nebula are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Triangulum Galaxy requires very dark skies (around Bortle 2 and below, which is around a surface brightness of 21 and above). Surface brightness is not a completely reliable predictor of visibility. Other factor like the actual luminosity distribution of the object are more important in affecting visibility. For instance, both the Orion Nebula and Andromeda Galaxy have extremely bright central cores.\\
	
	\underline{Note:} This question would benefit those who have actually burnt midnight oil to go stargazing.

\section{Star Charts}

A star chart or star map is a map of the night sky. Astronomers divide these into grids to use them more easily. They are used to identify and locate astronomical objects such as stars, constellations and galaxies. They have been used for human navigation since time immemorial. Note that a star chart differs from an astronomical catalog, which is a listing or tabulation of astronomical objects for a particular purpose. 

\subsection{Coordinate Lines}

To help with navigation, some star maps include coordinate lines that allow you to more accurately track down a faint fuzzy or an interesting object. The coordinates right ascension (RA) and declination (dec) – roughly equivalent to longitude and latitude on Earth – are sometimes marked on a star map. RA and dec (also represented by the Greek letter $\delta$) are coordinates marking a star’s (or galaxy’s) position with respect to two points in the sky:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The celestial equator (a line in the sky directly above the Earth’s equator). This can be represented by a straight line or a curve depending on viewing position but one key point to remember is that this line always goes from East, \textit{E} to West\textit{ W}.
    \item RA is measured as the angular distance along the celestial equator from the First Point of Aries, a position on the celestial equator in the constellation of Pisces. Rather than measure this angle in degrees, RA is measured in hours, minutes and seconds, so that the whole circle around the Earth is 24 hours.\footnote{I'll cover very little of Celestial Coordinate system here so knowledge of the different coordinate system--their conversion and how to draw a celestial sphere is presumed here. We'll need some hardcore knowledge of the time keeping systems also. I would suggest you read ``Astronomy Principles and Practice" by Roy and Clarke: Subchapters 8.1 – 8.5, 8.8 – 8.9, and 8.11}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cel.png}
    \caption{Celestial Sphere for EQS and ECS}
\end{figure}
    
    Therefore, when someone says that Canopus has an RA of $06^h 24^m$, it means that it's RA coordinate is just over one quarter of the way around the sky ($6^h$ is one-quarter of $24^h$) from the First Point of Aries. RA is always measured eastward from the First Point of Aries.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Projections}
A stereographic projection is mostly used, as is the convention for printed star maps. A planisphere is this type of star chart. But you might encounter different projects or a map of Horizon Views, showing the stars above the horizon as seen from a specified observing site at a given date and time. Another famous projection style which we also use for geographical position is Mercator projections. You'll encounter basically these 3 types of map projections. Now we will discuss each type of these maps and their pros and cons. 

\subsubsection{Horizon Views}

Horizon views shows the portion of the sky that is viewed by a Telescope Field of View (FOV) or Human eye. In astronomy, the field of view is the amount of sky you can see, whether with your unaided vision, binoculars, or a telescope. The FOV of a telescope varies due to usage of different telescope eyepieces whereas human eye spans approximately $120^\circ$ of arc. So FOV is an important part of these maps as they also provide us with a crucial information--the Range of the Sky! Also, a telescope which has a much smaller field of view will have significant advantages, such as greater magnification and light-gathering power. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Hor_1.png}
    \caption{View toward horizon from $23^\circ$ N $89^\circ$ E, azimuth $0^\circ$ (N) Wed 2022 Jan 26 0:27 UTC. Here the FOV is $75^\circ$}.
\end{figure}

To measure other information about the location of the observing place the chart should contain the \textit{Pole star} or the Azimuth of the sky portion should be close $0^\circ$. As we know the altitude of the Pole star is equal to the latitude of the Observing place, this makes the whole procedure easy. \\

One might ask how can we know the scale of the image? Your scale is the Ursa Major/Minor constellation itself! But with this particular viewing the longitude of the observing place can not be determined easily. But using the Dipper clock orientation you can determine the current month of the observation provided that you know the time when it was observed. This is important as same sky viewing constellation will be present at night once a year. But another thing to remember is that if you've seen this portion of the sky at midnight today, you can find the same orientation after 6 months at midday [If there was no atmosphere which we can do using Stellarium].\\

You'll get the same result for 06-26-2022 at 12:27 UTC. Don't just believe me try it yourself! A clever use of these type of maps are done in IOAA-18 O3 (See Figure \ref{A2018_O3}).

\end{figure}
The effect of changing latitude on Horizon views. Travelling south causes constellations in the north to sink towards the horizon.

\subsubsection{Round Maps}
Creating a star chart requires projecting the celestial sphere onto a two-dimensional plane. This section will focus on the most common projection method, called stereographic projection. The method works by setting the celestial sphere to a fixed radius and then placing
an imaginary plane on top of the sphere (some textbooks will have the plane go through the sphere's center). We imagine a light source at the bottom of the celestial sphere, and notice that every light ray emitted intersects the sphere and the plane once. We project a point
on the sphere by finding the corresponding light ray and mapping the point on the sphere to the intersection of this light ray and the plane. Finally, we scale the plane to the desired size, giving us a star chart. Note that stereographic projection cannot project the entire
celestial sphere as points closer and closer to the observer's nadir will become infinitely far away on the plane (to remedy this one can move the light source down past the bottom of the sphere, but then we lose some of the nice properties of the projection). The round maps of stereographic projection shows a bird eye view of the sky. Let's see an example--

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{stereo_1.eps}
    \caption{Stereographic projection of sky above $23.5^\circ$ North}
    \label{stereo_2}
\end{figure}

The round edge of each chart represents your horizon, with compass directions usually labeled. If not, then try to find the pole star. The line joining pole star and the center of the map reaches the both North and South cardinals. The side which is closest to Pole star is obviously your North. Turn the map around so the edge marked with the direction you’re facing (north, east, or whatever) is right-side up. The stars above this horizon on the map will now match the stars you’re facing. Ignore the rest of the map for now. The map’s center is overhead (the zenith). So a star that’s plotted halfway from the edge to the center can be found about halfway up the sky. That is, it will be halfway from horizontal to straight up. Dot sizes indicate star brightness — the larger the dot, the brighter the star. Example: Let’s try the July/August chart. Turn it so the horizon labeled “Facing West” is right-side up. About halfway from there to the center is the bright star Arcturus. Go outside around one of the dates and times listed, face west, and look halfway from horizontal to straight up. There’s Arcturus! To the right of Arcturus, in the northwest, is the Big Dipper. Turn the chart so the “Facing NW” horizon edge is right side up.When you hold the chart correctly, the Dipper’s handle stretches toward the upper left and its bowl is at lower right — just the way it looks in the northwestern sky. Nearly overhead, as you crane your neck up, is the bright star Vega. It’s part of the little constellation Lyra. You’ll notice that east is left of north on our charts, not to the right as on maps of the Earth. This is because the charts are used while looking up, not down. Note: In a stereographic projection, constellations near the edge of the sky chart are stretched and appear larger than if they were at the center of the chart\\

\textbf{Some key information to notice}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em 
    \item The celestial equator will always go from East to West. But this imaginary line in the sky can be an arc depending on the latitude of the observer. So you must know the constellations that resides on this path. One simple example is that celestial equator passes through the belt of Orion. So if you can first determine the cardinals, you can easily draw the equator with help of Orion.
    \item The ecliptic is the imaginary path in which the Sun moves throughout the year. The term zodiac comes from this concept. There are 13 constellations that lies in the ecliptic. But 12 are considered the famous Zodiac constellations. They are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. The Sun also passes through Ophiuchus, a constellation that has traditionally not been part of the zodiac family. It belongs to the Hercules family. One must also remember or be able to recognize this 12 constellations with their sequence. Then you can find the ecliptic.
    \item The intersection point of the equator and the ecliptic arc/line is the equinox point. So we have 2 equinox points $180^\circ$ apart. One is known as the first point of Aries \aries \; another is termed first point of Libra \libra. But the the names are misleading nowadays[!]. Yes the points are named using the constellation they were on. But due to some special effects like processional rotation the euqinoxes have shifted a bit. So the \aries \; point now lies on Pisces and \libra \; currently resides on Virgo. It is helpful to also remember their approximate position compared to nearby constellations.
\end{itemize}

Now we'll revisit the figure \ref{stereo_2} once again. Let's try to find how many things we can understand using this simple map. We will use above techniques to find out as many things as possible [See figure \ref{stereo_3}.]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The middle point of the map serves as the Zenith of the observer, shown by \textbf{Z} in figure \ref{stereo_3}.
    \item The first thing, I've found is Big Dipper which is an asterism a part of big and famous constellation Ursa Major.
    \item As you see it’s a map of Northern hemisphere. How can I tell? I've found Ursa Minor and it's brightest star Polaris! From basic celestial sphere knowledge we know that the altitude of Polaris is equal to Observer's Latitude.
    \item Using Polaris and \textbf{Z} point we can estimate the cardinals-- N,S,E,W. Notice that E and W are mirror than what is supposed to be. 
    \item From Big Dipper using the star Alkaid, using an arrow we can find brightest star (\nth{4} Brightest) of Bootes constellation, Arcturus! Shown using blue arrows, this is called star hopping. You can create your own star hopping shortcuts! We may discuss it later.
    \item Again, It's obviously night sky of Summer Season! How can I tell? Using another famous asterism Summer Triangle!
    \item Using the Zodiac Constellations--Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, and part of Sagittarius, we can determine the approx. path of the Sun also known as Ecliptic. Green line in the figure \ref{stereo_3}.
    \item Scorpius constellation is also known as Fish Hook asterism.
    \item The first point of Libra \libra , where the Ecliptic intersects with the Equator is also a known location. This location was once above Libra but it has now shifted to Virgo. Shown using a circled cross in figure \ref{stereo_3}.

\subsection{Pole View Maps}
Pole view maps are interesting as here the edge of the map represents both the observing horizon in horizontal coordinate system and equator for equatorial coordinate system. So with this, one can determine the position of the star in both measuring system. \\

\subsubsection{The precession of the Equinoxes}

The precession of the equinoxes is a gradual changing in the direction of the Earth’s rotation axis, which causes the position of the celestial poles to drift westward through the constellations at a continuous rate of roughly \textbf{$\mathbf{50\frac{1}{4}''}$ annually}. Although this effect is small on short timescales, the accumulated drift adds up to about one Moon diameter per century.\\

The precessional motion causes the north and south rotational poles
to trace out circles around the pole of the ecliptic (in $T_{pr}\approx 25770$ year). Currently the Earth’s north celestial pole points close to the star Polaris, but this will not always be the case. By 2500, Polaris will be several degrees away from the true celestial pole.\\

The precession of the Earth's rotation axis causes the ecliptic longitude to change linearly but the ecliptic latitude remains constant. Suppose that at a certain point in time the star has coordinates ($\alpha_{old}, \delta_{old}$) and ($\lambda_{old}, \beta$). It is necessary to calculate its coordinates ($\alpha_{new}, \delta_{new}$) and ($\lambda_{new}, \beta$) after time $t$: 


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.6\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{presc1.png}
		\caption{Precessional Circle}
		\label{pcircle}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{0.35\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{potd65a.pdf}
		\vspace{3cm}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
From spherical triangle shown above:
\begin{align*}
	\cos(90^\circ-\beta)&=\cos\varepsilon \sin\delta_{old}+\sin\varepsilon\cos\delta_{old}\cos(90^\circ+\alpha)\\
	\sin\beta&=\cos\varepsilon \sin\delta_{old}-\sin\varepsilon\cos\delta_{old}\sin\alpha_{old}
\end{align*}
Again, 
\[	\sin\delta_{old} =\sin \beta_\star \cos\varepsilon+\cos\beta_\star \sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda_{old} \implies \sin\lambda_{old}=\frac{\sin\delta_{old}-\cos\varepsilon \sin\beta}{\sin\varepsilon \cos\beta}\]
\[	\frac{\cos \lambda_{old} }{\cos \delta_{old}}=\frac{\cos\alpha_{old}}{\cos\beta_\star} \implies 
\cos\lambda_{old}=\frac{\cos\delta_{old}\cos\alpha_{old}}{\cos\beta}\]
Now the new Ecliptic Coordinates after Precession: 
   \begin{gather*}
	\beta_{new} =\beta_{old}\\
	\lambda_{new}=\lambda_{old}+\Delta \lambda= \lambda_{old}+\frac{t}{26000\;\rm years}\ast 360^\circ
\end{gather*}
Equatorial Coordinates after Precession (Similarly):
\begin{align*}
	\sin\delta'_\star&=\sin\beta'_\star\cos\varepsilon+\cos\beta'_\star \sin \varepsilon \sin\lambda_{old}\\		\delta_{new}&=\arcsin(\cos\varepsilon\sin\beta+\sin\varepsilon\cos\beta \sin\lambda_{new})
\end{align*}
\begin{gather*}
	\begin{cases}
		\sin\alpha_{new}=\dfrac{\cos\varepsilon\sin\delta_{new}-\sin\beta}{\sin\varepsilon\cos\delta_{new}}\\
		\cos\alpha_{new}=\dfrac{\cos\beta\cos\lambda_{new}}{\cos\delta_{new}}
	\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

\subsection*{Finding new Pole Star}
Right now, Polaris ($\alpha$ Ursa Minor) is the ``north pole star'', however Thuban ($\alpha$ Draco) was the ``north pole star'' when it was around 3000 BC.

\begin{enumerate}[Q1.]
	\itemsep0em 
	\item Mark Thuban on Figure \ref{precession}
	\item We know that Thuban was passed by north celestial pole, and Polaris is also passed by north celestial pole. Based on this, we can find the north ecliptic pole. Find the north ecliptic pole!
	\item Measure the period of the precession.
	\item Find the equatorial coordinate of Polaris when Thuban was the ``north pole star''.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{sol}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{thuban.png}
		\caption{Thuban as North Pole}
		\label{precession}
	\end{figure}
\textbf{Q2} We can find the north ecliptic pole by drawing two circles with its radius of $23.5^\circ$ which the center of each circle is on Polaris and Thuban. We will get 2 intersections, E and the other one.\\
By considering the ecliptic line, we know that \textbf{E} is the north ecliptic pole (white circle), not the other one.\\

\textbf{Q3} First, we measure the angle of $\angle PET$. There are some ways to measure this angle. Some possible methods are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Measure PT $\rightarrow$ PT = $25.8^\circ$.
	Using cosine rule we get $\rightarrow \cos\angle PET =0.361$ or $\angle PET= 68.8^\circ$.\\
	(for cosine rule in spherical geometry, $\angle PET= 68^\circ$)
	\item Direct method (using protactor) $\angle PET= 69^\circ\; \text{or} \; 70^\circ$ (need to be measured again)
	\item Get a line from T and tangential to line PE. The intersect is at F, then : $\sin\angle PET = TF/TE$. From this method we get $\angle PET$ around $66^\circ$. (not really recommended)
\end{itemize}

Based from all these method, the range of $\angle PET= 65 -70^\circ$.
The time required to make this angle is = 3000 +20XX= 50XX years (XX = current year after 2000 CE). Thus the range of period of precession is: 25800-7800 years (These are only for the range, each team can get full mark if their answer is within this range)\\

\textbf{Q4}  $PT=25.8^\circ$, hence $\delta_{\rm polaris} = 90-PT =64.2^\circ$.\\

From sin rule, we get $\angle ETP = 58.1^\circ$ or $3^h52^m30^s$. (for sin rule in spherical geometry, it is $58.2^\circ$, still similar to flat one). We know $\alpha_{\text{North Ecliptic Pole}}=18^h$. Now, 
\begin{align*}
	\alpha_{\rm polaris}=& \alpha_{\text{North Ecliptic Pole}}+ \angle ETP\\
	\alpha_{\rm polaris}=& 21^h52^m30^s
\end{align*}

Hence, the equatorial coordinate Polaris 6000 years ago is: $(\alpha, \delta)= (21^h 52^m 30^s,\, 64.2^\circ)$
\end{sol}
\begin{pro}
	\textbf{Problem: Drifting Equinox} The Vernal Equinox occurs nowadays when the Sun is in the constellation of Pisces. Pisces covers a section of the ecliptic
	from longitude $352^\circ$ to longitude $28^\circ$; at longitude $28^\circ$ the ecliptic passes into Aries.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{vernal_point.pdf}
	\end{figure}
	How many years would we have to go back, to find the Sun at ``the First Point of Aries'' at the Vernal Equinox?
\end{pro}


Because of precession, our framework of Right Ascension and declination is constantly changing. Consequently, it is necessary to state the equator and equinox of the coordinate system to which any position is referred. Astronomers will report the coordinates of an object based on the celestial equator and vernal equinox of a specific time and date; this is called the epoch. Certain dates (e.g. 1950.0, 2000.0) are taken as standard epochs, and used for star catalogues, etc.

\section{Celestial Navigation}
Celestial navigation has a rich and interesting history. The navigator would use ‘sights’, or angular measurements taken between a celestial body (e.g., the Sun, the Moon, Polaris, or one of 57 other navigational stars and planets) and the visible horizon to locate one’s position in the world, on land
as well as at sea.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{navigation.png}
\end{figure}

 Let us explore a simple application of Celestial Navigation using our wrist watch. To use our watch as a compass in the northern hemisphere, hold the watch horizontal and point the hour hand at the Sun. The halfway mark between the hour hand and the twelve o’clock mark is south. For example, if it is 8 o’clock, point the 8 on the watch face at the Sun. South would then be at the 10 o’clock position. If it is 4 o’clock, point the 4 on the watch face at the Sun. South would be in the 2 o’clock position.

\subsection{Problem Solving Tips}

Positional astronomy requires the use of methods that are not usually used in any other content seen in schools or in other Olympiads, and for this reason it can and will be a little difficult to advance through the problems in this topic, especially for students who are just starting out, but even those who have qualified for the more advanced phases can make fatal mistakes when solving these questions. However, there are some tips that can help progress in this field.

\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep0em 
	\item \textbf{Make a 3D drawing of the situation}
	
	The first step to solving any positional astronomy problem is to understand and visualize what is happening, and good drawing is fundamental in this process. In general, it is strongly recommended to make a three-dimensional drawing for all situations\footnote{For meridian crossing problems, a 2D section of the celestial sphere is sufficient, however a 3D drawing can facilitate visualization}, especially in questions of spherical trigonometry.
	
	\item \textbf{In the drawing, represent values close to those in the statement}
	
	If the statement says that there is an observer with latitude $\phi = -80^\circ$ observing a star with $\delta = 50^\circ$, it is recommended to make a drawing in which the PCS is relatively close to the zenith. This can help you identify particular cases and estimate the final answer\footnote{For example, if the drawing shows that a star culminates close to the horizon, but its result is $h = 80^\circ$, something may have gone wrong.}. Furthermore, in questions of spherical trigonometry, this analysis is especially relevant for identifying the quadrant of certain angles. Certain trigonometric functions only work for certain quadrants, and therefore it is important to identify them before doing the math.
	
	\item \textbf{Not memorizing final formulas}
	
	Many results in positional astronomy are particular cases that are not taken into account in the formulas. For example, the equations obtained do not work for observers in the Southern Hemisphere or for stars in the Eastern Hemisphere. Therefore, the ideal is to understand the procedure used and adapt it according to each question - just memorize the three laws of spherical trigonometry.
	
	\item \textbf{Be careful with inverse trigonometric functions}
	
	In questions of spherical trigonometry, it is usually necessary to use inverse trigonometric functions to obtain numerical results. However, they do not provide unique values. Therefore, you may need to find both the sine and cosine of an angle to determine its value\footnote{To do this, it would be necessary to use more than one law of spherical trigonometry}. Furthermore, if your drawing is very well done, it is possible to identify which of the values is the true one.
\end{enumerate}






\subsection{Naked Eye Observation}

\textsf{\textbf{Upper and Lower Culmination}}

For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the altitude of a celestial body is maximum when it passes through the meridian, in the southern direction. In this case, the body is said to be in upper culmination and its hour angle is $H= 0^h$. The altitude is minimum when the object is passing through the anti-meridian. Now, the body is said to be in lower culmination and its hour angle is $H = 12^h$. In the derivation that follows, we consider only the case of an observer in the
northern hemisphere, so $\phi \geq 0^\circ$.\\

I've used a 2D geometry of the situations described. I'll denote Upper culmination south of zenith as $h_{U1}$, Upper culmination north of zenith as $h_{U2}$ and lower culmination as $h_l$.
\begin{multicols}{2}
Now for $h_{U1}$ and $\delta=-\rm ve$,
\begin{align*}
	90^\circ &=\phi+ (-\delta)+ h_{U1}\\
	h_{U1} &= 90^\circ-\phi+\delta 
\end{align*} 

Now for $h_{U1}$ and $\delta=+\rm ve$,
\begin{align*}
	90^\circ &=\delta-\phi + h_{U11}\\
	h_{U11} &= 90^\circ-\phi+\delta 
\end{align*} 
\end{multicols}
For, Upper culmination, $h_{U2}$, and we denote zenith angle of upper culmination, $ZA_{U2}=\delta-\phi$ and $\delta>0$ always
\begin{align*}
	90^\circ &= \phi +PU_2+ZA_{U2}\\
	&= \underbrace{\phi+ (90^\circ-\delta)}_{h_{U2}}+ZA_{U2}\\
	h_{U2} &=90-\delta +\phi
\end{align*}

So we can write in total 

\begin{defi}
\begin{equation}
	\boxed{h_U =\begin{cases}
			90^\circ - \phi + \delta, & \text{if the object culminates south of zenith;} \\
			90^\circ + \phi - \delta, & \text{if the object culminates north of zenith.}
	\end{cases}}
\end{equation}	
\end{defi}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{circumpolar.pdf}
\end{figure}

The altitude of lower culmination $h_l$, measured by convention from the northern horizon, is then:
\begin{align*}
	90^\circ&= h_{l}+PU_l+(90^\circ-\phi)\\
	h_l&=90^\circ -(90^\circ-\delta)-(90^\circ-\phi)  \quad [\because PU_l=PU_2]
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}
	\boxed{h_l=\delta+\phi-90^\circ}
\end{equation}
Let us examine some special cases:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em 
	\item when $h_l>0$ i.e $\delta >90^\circ -\phi$, the object is circumpolar and it never sets;
	\item when $h_U<0$ i.e $\delta <\phi-90^\circ$, it is never visible;
	\item $\phi-90^\circ <\delta<90^\circ-\phi$, the object rises and sets
\end{itemize}
For a circumpolar star we can write, 
\begin{defi}
\[\boxed{\delta=\frac{1}{2}(h_U+h_l)}\quad\quad\boxed{\phi=90^\circ- \frac{1}{2}(h_U-h_l)}\]	
\end{defi}

\textsf{\textbf{Local Sidereal Time}}\\

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\linewidth}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lst_cel.pdf}
\end{wrapfigure}
Our wrist watches keep track of when the sun will be at transit. The solar time-keeping system we use ensures that our working day contains repeats with the rising and setting of the sun. Astronomers are however more interested in keeping track of the stars, since they want to observe them. They therefore use a sidereal time-keeping system to keep track of the vernal equinox (instead of the sun).\\

Once you know the time before or since the vernal equinox was at transit you can easily determine when any other star will be at transit. This is true, since there exists a simple relation between the hour angle of a celestial body and your local sidereal time which is given by:

\[\boxed{\text{LST}= \text{RA}_\star + \text{HA}_\star=\text{HA}_{\aries}} \]

\section*{Practice Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Name the constellations where the Milky Way passes through that are visible from Northern and Southern hemisphere}
	\begin{sol}
	The rotational Galactic Center of the Milky Way lies in the direction of Sagittarius, with the glowing band of hazy light then stretching all the way across to its anticenter in Auriga, before returning back to Sagittarius. From Earth, stargazers can see 30 constellations contained in this region of sky, some of which only faintly touch the region.\\
	
	- \textsf{Northern}: Monoceros, Canis Major, Orion, Gemini, Taurus, Auriga, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Lacerta, Cepheus, Cygnus, Vulpecula, Sagitta, Aquila, Serpens, Sagittarius, Scutum, Ophiuchus, Scorpius.\\
	
	- \textsf{Southern}: Norma, Lupus, Ara, Circinus, Triangulum, Crux, Musca, Carina, Vela, Pyxis, Puppis.
	\end{sol}

	\item \textbf{Write down any five constellations that lie on current celestial equator}
	\begin{sol}
		- Virgo (Vir), Serpens (Ser), Ophiuchus (Oph), Aquila (Aql), Aquarius (Aqr), Pisces (Psc), Cetus (Cet), Libra (Lib), Hercules (Her), Scutum (Sct), Delphinus (Del), Equuleus (Equ), Pegasus (Peg).
	\end{sol}
	\item \textbf{How to find/point at the vernal equinox?}
	\begin{sol}
		- The vernal equinox is located slightly south of the circlet of Pisces. There is no bright star near its exact location hence it can be identified only through practice.
	\end{sol}
	
	\item \textbf{In order to know your latitude from stargazing alone, what other piece(s) of information do you need?}
	\begin{sol}
	- Stars' altitude and declination.
	\end{sol}
			\item \textbf{In the constellation Crux, the} $\alpha\,, \beta, \,\gamma$ and $\delta$ \textbf{stars are named in which order?}
	\begin{sol}
		- Clockwise
	\end{sol}
	\item \textbf{Which of these stars cannot be observed by an observer at certain location?}

\begin{sol}
	\textsf{Circumpolar Stars}\\
	
	This question relies on your comprehension of the night sky and rough idea of where the major stars are located. A concept introduced by this question is of circumpolar stars: they are stars that either never set or never rise. As the question asks the star that cannot be observed, it means that it asks for the lower circumpolar stars (stars that never rise) for an observer at certain location.
	The only challenge is to realize that lower circumpolar stars peak at an altitude of $\delta+ 90^\circ -\phi$,
	where $\delta$ is the declination of a star and $\phi$ is the latitude of the observer. The condition for lower
	circumpolar stars would be that this altitude $< 0^\circ$. Therefore, the condition becomes $90^\circ + \delta <\phi$.

\begin{sol}
- Sidereal time is calculated from the hour angle + RA of a particular object, where the hour angle is the number of hours after the object has passed the meridian. In other words if 0h is the local meridian, 18h would be at the western horizon. In this case, it is given that 19h52min is at that horizon. This means that the correct local sidereal time is 1h52m.

\item \textbf{Filters are often used in practical astronomy for image enhancement, especially when imaging deep-sky objects as they appear very dim even through a telescope. When imaging an emission nebula, which color/combination of filter(s) can be used to minimise light from background sources, thus allowing the nebula to stand out better?}

\begin{sol}
- An emission nebula emits light that is dominated by the H-$\alpha$ spectral line (657 nm) of the Balmer series (ionized hydrogen emission). Hence, an emission nebula appears red. To enhance the image, one should minimize light from other background sources (non-red light) to enter the eye. Hence,
one should use a red color filter to allow the nebula to stand out more.Yellow filters are generally used when trying to look at the yellow dust tails of comets and not DSOs. Stacking all of the filters listed defeats the purpose of using a color filter, which is to expose the sensor to light of a
certain wavelength (color).

\item \textbf{For an observer in the Northern Hemisphere, how does the right ascension of the Sun change from the start to the end of Summer?}
\begin{sol}
\textit{NB: we define the start of a season by its corresponding equinox/solstice. So the summer solstice marks the start of Summer.}\\

- Recall that during the northern vernal equinox, the Sun is at 0h by definition. The right ascension of the sun increases as the season progresses. Further, after 1 season, the Earth would have moved along 1/4 of its orbit, leading to From 6h to 12h.

- The celestial equator is tilted at an angle equal to your latitude from the zenith. In this case, the celestial equator is $45^\circ$ from your zenith and therefore $45^\circ$ above the southern horizon. The Sun is $23.5^\circ$ above the celestial equator on the summer solstice. Therefore the Sun is $23.5^\circ+ 45^\circ= 68.5^\circ$ above the southern horizon.
\end{sol}

\item \textbf{Let’s consider stars for which it is true at the same time: (i) in their diurnal motion they cross the horizon, and (ii) their upper culmination occurs to the north of the zenith. Express the fraction of such stars as a function of latitude $\phi$. Assume that stars are distributed uniformly over the celestial sphere.}

\begin{sol}
\begin{eqnarray*}

\item \textbf{Estimating the Local Sidereal Time (LST) from Star Chart.}

\begin{sol}

\textsf{Method 1: Using RA of known object and estimating LHA to obtain LST}\\

From the definitions of the following variables, the following equation relates LST, RA at meridian and local hour angle (LHA),
\[LHA_{\rm obj}=LST-RA_{\rm obj}\]
Then, find an object with known RA, and estimate its LHA. For an object on the meridian, $LHA = 0$. For rising and setting objects, $LHA < 0$ or $LHA > 0$ respectively.\\

e.g. Arcturus has a RA of $14^h15^m$; it is estimated to have crossed the meridian (LHA) about 30 mins ago, i.e. $LHA_{\rm Arcturus} = 0^h30^m$.

Hence, $LST=LHA_{\rm obj}+RA_{\rm obj}=14^h15^m+ 0^h30^m \approx \mathbf{14^h45^m}$.\\

\textsf{Method 2: By first principles, definition of LST}\\

By definition, the $LST = LHA_{\rm Vernal \;Equinox}$, and $RA_{\rm Vernal\; Equinox} = 0^\circ$.\\

In a tropical (calendar) year, there are 365.25 solar days, but 366.25 sidereal days. By definition, \textbf{at local noon} on the day of Vernal Equinox (usually around March 20-21), the vernal equinox is at the local meridian everywhere, thus $LST = 0^h$.\\

Thus, the $LST$ at local noon every day after that increases by a small amount equal to the time required for the Earth to rotate an extra small angle due to its orbital motion, i.e. for each complete solar day the Earth completes a small fraction of the extra sidereal day. This amount is,
\[\Delta LST=\frac{1\; \rm day}{366.25\; \rm day}\times 24^h00^m= 3.93^m=3^m56^s\]

If we take January 28, approximately 10 months and 7 days after Vernal Equinox (there is inaccuracy introduced here as each month is not of equal length),
\[LST_{\text{noon of 28 Jan}}=\left(\frac{10}{12}\times 365.25+7 \right)\times 3^m56^s= 1197^m=20.40^h\]

If we do have a calendar, we can get a more accurate calculation, with 313 days between March 21 and January 28
\[LST_{\text{noon of 28 Jan}}=313\times 3^m56^s=1231^m=20.51^h\]
 
Now if we know time when any starchart is taken, Suppose the starchart was taken at 06:15 UTC, i.e. 6.15am at the Greenwich
Meridian,
\[LST_{\text{6.15 am on 28 Jan}} \approx 20.51^h-(12^h-6.25^h)=14.76^h \approx \mathbf{14^h45^m}\]
\end{sol} 

\clearpage
\item \textbf{Estimating the Local Time (LT) from Star Chart.}\\ 

\begin{sol}
For this you must know coordinates of a star lying on Celestial Equator. Recall that Orion lies along the celestial equator – and that one notable feature of the Belt of Orion are the declination of the belt stars, that is, their declination is close to $0^\circ$.\\

As an estimate, we take Mintaka’s declination to be $0^\circ$, such that it would culminate at the zenith (center of the starchart) when the local sidereal time is equal to its right ascension. Now estimate weather Mintaka is to the /east/west of the local meridian, i.e. if it has already culminated and thus its hour angle will be $HA>0$. Thus, we measure Mintaka's distance from the center of the starchart (zenith), to estimate its hour angle, d= X cm. Then the fraction outward from the center of the starchart of radius is, $f=d/r$.

Then, to a first approximation, ignoring distortion from the stereographic projection, the hour angle $HA$ of Mintaka from the zenith is approximately, $HA= 90^\circ \times f$. Then the local sidereal time at the time of the starchart is (right ascension of Mintaka $\alpha=5^h 33^m$) 
\[LST=HA+\alpha\]
Let's take a star chart  that is dated 11 Mar, close to the vernal equinox 21 March, we can take the $LST_{0000}$ at local solar midnight as approximately $12^h-10\times 4^m= 11^h0^m$.\\

Then, to find the local sidereal time at local civil midnight, we need to introduce a correction as Observer's timezone (UTC+LT) is not in alignment with its longitude ($\lambda$),
\begin{align*}
	LST_{0000}'&=LST_{0000}-\Delta LST\\
	&=LST-\left(LT-\frac{\lambda}{360}(24^h)\right)
\end{align*}

Therefore, the time before midnight $\Delta T$ is simply the difference in the local sidereal times at the time of the starchart and at local civil midnight, 
\[\Delta T=LST_{0000}'-LST\]

Therefore, the local time of the star chart is $0000h -\Delta T =$ \textbf{ANSWER}. 
\end{sol}

\item \textbf{Estimating the position of the Moon on certain local time on Star Chart after certain days.}

\begin{sol}
At the same local (civil) time on the \textbf{next day}, the night sky would have rotated westward by an amount approximately $4^m$ in RA.\\

However, due to the Moon's orbital motion about the Earth (anti-clockwise), it moves eastward relative to the fixed stars and its RA increases by approximately,
\begin{align*}
	\Delta RA&=\frac{360^\circ}{T_{\rm sid}}\\
	&=\frac{360^\circ}{27.3\; \rm days}\\
	&=13.19^\circ /\rm days\\
	& \approx 53^m/\rm day
\end{align*}
Since the Moon's orbital plane is similar to the rest of the planets, it will thus appear eastward along the ecliptic by about 50 mins.
\end{sol}

\item \textbf{Star-trails} Your task in this problem will be to take a photo of star-trails in the sky (stars) they draw due to the rotation of the Earth around its own axis. You can use either method to do this-- several shorter exposures, which you then combine into a single image using appropriate software, or taking one long exposure.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\itemsep0em 
	\item Take a photo of the star-trails so that the image contains the North Pole. Try to be as long as possible so that arcs form, the corresponding hour angle should definitely exceed $0^h10^m$. Describe in detail the procedure taking a picture. Record the time and place of acquisition, the length of individual exposures and parameters in the solution camera. Attach a printed photo in inverted colors to your solution.
	\item What curves do the stars plot in the photograph depending on the declination $\delta_\ast$ of the star and also on
	declination $\delta_c$ of the center of the frame? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{sol}
To solve this problem, we will assume for simplicity that the rays are coming from infinity as it passes through the lens does not change direction when passing through the optical center. Then it is clear that such rays from a given star describe the mantle of a cone during the day
with an apex angle of $180^\circ - 2\delta_\ast$, the axis of which intersects the plane of the camera sensor at an angle
$\delta_c$. The trajectories of the stars in the image will therefore be conic sections. If the star never sets
below the sensor plane $(|\delta_\ast-\delta_c|> 90^\circ)$, this is generally an ellipse (in the special case, when the world pole is in the center of the image, i.e, $\delta_c = 90^\circ$, the stars will draw circle). If the lower culmination of the star occurs in the plane of the sensor, it is a parabola  $(|\delta_\ast+\delta_c|=90^\circ)$. If the star falls below the plane of the sensor (but also rises above
the plane of the sensor, i.e,  $|\delta_\ast +\delta_c|< 90^\circ$ and  $|\delta_c- \delta_\ast|< 90^\circ$), it is generally a hyperbola. And in the special case when we have $\delta_\ast = 0$, the cone degenerates into a plane. Stars of the world therefore, the equator draws a line in the image.\\

Note: Star trails start becoming visibly apparent when a source that covers 1px stretches out to span 5px in any direction

\subsubsection{Problem: Plotting the Moon and Planets}
\begin{multicols}{2}
	
In this task, you have a map of the entire sky in the Mercator projection, in which the ecliptic coordinates are displayed as a rectangular grid. The map shows the ecliptic, the equator, and the position of the Sun. The local sidereal time is 14 h 30 min. Your task is to plot the positions of the planets and the Moon on the map, assuming that all of these objects are on the ecliptic at the given time. You can use the following information.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep0em 
		\item \textbf{Mercury} is in the most ideal position possible to be observed in the morning before sunrise.

		\item We observe \textbf{Jupiter} with an angular diameter of $31.12''$
		\item \textbf{Saturn} has an ecliptic longitude of $150^\circ$.
		\item \textbf{Uranus} has a right ascension of $12^h$
		\item \textbf{Neptune} is highest above the horizon
	\end{itemize}
	For each object, at least briefly justify your procedure.

	\textbf{Mercury}\\
	

	The ideal conditions for observing Mercury are when it is at maximum elongation. We observe it in the morning before sunrise, so it is west of the Sun, i.e. at maximum western elongation. Mercury's orbit has a large eccentricity, so the actual distance of Mercury from the Sun significantly affects the maximum angular distance it can reach from the Sun when viewed from Earth. We are interested in the ideal conditions, which occur at the greatest possible angular distance of Mercury from the Sun. Mercury must then be at aphelion, its distance from the Sun is
	
	\[r_a=a_M(1+e_M)\]
	We calculate the angular distance of Mercury from the Sun based on Fig. \ref{mercury_tri}
	\[\sin\Delta \lambda =\frac{r_a}{r_\oplus}=\frac{a_M}{a_\oplus}(1+e_M)\]
	
	Therefore $\Delta \lambda\approx
	28^\circ$
	
\newpage
	
	\textbf{Venus}
	
	\begin{multicols}{2}
	
	From the photo of Venus we can find its phase angle, from which we can then determine the angular distance of Venus from the Sun. First we measure the diameter of the Venus disk $2r$ and the distance $r'$. The radius of Venus in the image is $r = 2.8$ cm (of course, it depends on the scale in which the image is printed). The distance of the boundary between light and shadow from the center of the Venus disk is $r'=1.3$ cm.\\
	
	Figure \ref{venus2} shows a schematic drawing of the view of Venus from Earth and from above. The angle $\xi$ is calculated as
	
	\[\xi=\frac{r'}{r}\]
	
	The line pointing towards the Sun is perpendicular to the boundary between light and shadow, therefore the sum of the angle $\xi$ and the phase angle $\psi$ is equal to $90^\circ$. Therefore, for the phase angle,
	\[\cos\psi=\frac{r'}{r}\]
	
	Numerically we get $\psi= 62^\circ$.
	
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{venus_pos1.pdf}
	\caption{Calculation of the phase angle of Venus.}
	\label{venus2}
\end{figure}

The angular distance between Venus and the Sun can be obtained from the sine law for the Sun-Earth-Venus triangle, see Fig. \ref{venus3}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{venus_pos2.pdf}

\begin{gather*}
	\frac{a_V}{\sin\Delta \lambda}=\frac{a_\oplus}{\sin\psi}\\
	\Delta \lambda =\arcsin\left(\frac{a_v}{a_\oplus}\sin\psi\right) \approx 40^\circ
\end{gather*}
As stated in the assignment, the north is up in the image. The shadow is on the right, which means that Venus is west of the Sun.

\end{multicols}


\textbf{Moon}\\

The Moon is in first quarter, meaning it is located $90^\circ$ east of the Sun.\\

\textbf{Mars}\\

In the case of Mars and Jupiter, we only know their angular diameter. We will try to calculate their angular diameters in significant aspects to see if they match the given values. We will try opposition and conjunction first, in which the planets have the largest and smallest angular diameters. For Mars, we get
\begin{gather*}
	\theta_{\text{M,c}} = \frac{2R_{\text{M}}}{a_{\text{M}} + a_{\oplus}} = 1.8 \cdot 10^{-5} \text{ rad} = 3.7'',\\
	\theta_{\text{M,o}} = \frac{2R_{\text{M}}}{a_{\text{M}} - a_{\oplus}} = 8.66 \cdot 10^{-5} \text{ rad} = 17.9''.
\end{gather*}
We see that the angular diameter of Mars at the opposition matches the value given in the assignment. Mars is therefore $180^\circ$ away from the Sun.\\

\textbf{Jupiter}\\

The angular diameter of Jupiter in conjunction and opposition is
\begin{gather*}
	\theta_{\text{Jup,c}} = \frac{2R_{\text{Jup}}}{a_{\text{Jup}} + a_{\oplus}} = 1.51 \cdot 10^{-4} \text{ rad} = 31.1'',\\
	\theta_{\text{Jup,o}} = \frac{2R_{\text{Jup}}}{a_{\text{Jup}} - a_{\oplus}} = 2.22 \cdot 10^{-4} \text{ rad} = 45.8''.
\end{gather*}


The given value matches Jupiter's angular diameter in conjunction, so Jupiter will be positioned in the same location on the map as the Sun.\\

\textbf{Saturn}\\

Saturn has an ecliptic longitude of \(150^\circ\), so on the map, you only need to measure the corresponding distance of \(150^\circ\). Ecliptic longitude is measured from the vernal equinox towards the east. Since the distance from the vernal equinox to the edge of the map is insufficient, Saturn will be positioned at the right edge of the map.\\

\textbf{Uranus}\\

Uranus has a right ascension of \(12^h\), meaning it is located at the autumnal equinox. This point is in the constellation of Virgo, where the ecliptic intersects the equator.\\

\textbf{Neptune}

From the given problem, we know that Neptune is currently culminating, meaning it is on the meridian. Its meridian position can either be estimated (less accurately) or calculated using spherical formulas. The hour angle of objects on the meridian is \(0^h\), so its right ascension is equal to the sidereal time:

\[
\alpha = 14^h 30^m = 217.5^\circ.
\]

Right ascension is not the same as ecliptic longitude, but we can assume similar values for practical purposes. Neptune will be plotted at an ecliptic longitude of \(\lambda = 217.5^\circ\). Both values should be approximately the same. To obtain the exact longitude \(\lambda\), spherical trigonometry formulas must be used.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{liptosvka4.pdf}
	\caption{Ec-Eq Coordinate Transformation}
	\label{eq_ec}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{eq_ec}, we have a spherical triangle used for converting between ecliptic and equatorial coordinates. The problem assumes that all planets lie precisely on the ecliptic, meaning their ecliptic latitude is \(\beta = 0^\circ\). Since we know \(\beta\), \(\alpha\), and the obliquity of the ecliptic \(\varepsilon\), we apply the cosine rule:
\[
\sin \beta = \sin \delta \cos \varepsilon + \cos \delta \sin \varepsilon \cos(90^\circ + \alpha),
\]
which, using \(\sin \beta = 0\), simplifies further to
\[
\tan \delta = \tan \varepsilon \cos(90^\circ + \alpha).
\]

Using the properties of sine and cosine, this expression can be further simplified:
\begin{gather*}
	\cos(90^\circ + \alpha) = -\cos(90^\circ - \alpha) = -\sin \alpha,\\
	\tan \delta = \tan \varepsilon \sin \alpha.
\end{gather*}

The declination of Neptune is \(\delta = -15^\circ\). We calculate its ecliptic longitude using the sine rule (with additional simplifications using sine and cosine properties):

\[
\cos \lambda = \frac{\cos \delta}{\cos \beta \cos \alpha}.
\]

Using the \(\arccos\) function on a calculator, we obtain \(\lambda' = 140^\circ\), which is not the correct result—it should be close to the right ascension. Using the cosine property \(\cos x = \cos(360^\circ - x)\), we find \(\lambda = 220^\circ\). Since the difference from the right ascension is only \(2.5^\circ\), we see that \(\lambda = \alpha\) is a reasonable approximation. When plotting on the map, this positional difference is negligible.

\subsection{Telescope Aided Observation}
Naked eye observations are fun (and necessary for the competition), but the real fun begins when we help our eye out by using telescopes - powerful instruments that reveal a whole new side to the starry sky! Telescopes can mainly be classified based on whether they use refraction or reflection for magnification, as well as their mounts and what coordinate system they are set up to follow. In this section, we will give a short introduction to all of these classifications that are necessary for you as a competitor in the IOAA to know.\\

\textbf{1. Eyepiece}\\ 

Lens placed near the focal point of the telescope.\\
\textit{Determines:} magnification, apparent FoV, true FoV, and other specifications. Each eyepiece has a focal length just like the telescope.\\


\textbf{2. F-Number}\\ 

Telescopes are often described by both their aperture size and f number. The f-number is the ratio of the focal length of the main lens or mirror to the aperture. In astronomy, as in photography, the aperture ratio is often denoted by $f/n$ (e. g. $f/8$), where $n$ is the focal length divided by the aperture. For fast telescopes this ratio can be $f/1. . . . f/3$, but usually it is smaller, $f/8. . . . f/15$. These specifications are important because the brightness, size, and clarity of the image produced by a telescope depend on the aperture and focal length of its main lens or mirror. For example, a “150-mm (6-inch), f/8 reflector” means the primary mirror is 150 mm (6 inches) in diameter and has a focal length of 1200 mm (8 $\times$150), or 48 inches (8$\times$6).\\

If the aperture ratio is large, near unity, one has a powerful, ``fast'' telescope; this means that one can take photographs using short exposures, since the image is bright. A small aperture ratio (the focal length much greater than the aperture) means a ``slow'' telescope.\\

\textsf{\textbf{Question}} A special telescope features a 3x optical scope  with a diameter of 25mm, and a length of 120mm. Find the f-number of the scope.\\

\textbf{3. Magnification}\\
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{tel_magnify.png}
\end{figure}
So for a given telescope, changing the eyepiece to another with a lower focal length will increase the magnification.
\begin{defi}
	\[\text{Magnification}=\frac{\text{Telescope focal length}}{\text{Eyepiece focal length}}=\frac{\text{Aperture}\times \text{Focal Ratio}}{\text{Eye Piece Focal Length}}\]
\end{defi} 
\textbf{4. Field of View}\\

In general, the field of view (FOV) describes the area of a target (measured as an angle from the location of viewing) that can be seen on the chip of a CCD-camera or when looking through an eyepiece.\\

\underline{\textsf{Equation of FOV}}\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{FOV1.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{defi}
	\[\text{FoV[deg]}= \omega \times t \times \cos(\text{declination})=\frac{360^\circ}{23^h56^m4^s.1}\times t\times \cos\delta\]
\end{defi}

If the star passes through the chord of the field of view, you can measure the magnitude of the central angle, which rests on this chord. $t$ - is the time during which the star passes through this chord. Then this chord $= vt \times \cos\delta $. The same chord $=a\cdot \sin\frac{\gamma}{2}$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{FOV2.png}
\end{figure}

\textsf{Actual/True field of view (TFOV):} the angular size of the amount of sky that can	be seen through an eyepiece when used with a particular telescope, producing a specific magnification. It is typically between one tenth of a degree, and two degrees.\\ 

\textsf{Apparent field of view (AFOV):} it is a measure of the angular size of the image viewed through the eyepiece, in other words, how large the image appears (as distinct from the magnification). This is constant for any given eyepiece of fixed focal length, and may be used to calculate what the actual field of view will be when the eyepiece is used with a given telescope. The measurement ranges from 30 to 110 degrees.\\

If the apparent field of view is known, the actual field of view can be calculated from the following approximate formula:
\[\text{TFOV}=\frac{\rm AFOV}{M}\]
For a telescope with focal length of $f$, object image size of $d$,
\[\text{AFOV}=2\cdot \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2f}\right)\]

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{FOV.png}
	\caption{Same magnification but different AFoV and TFoV}
\end{figure}

\textbf{5. Planetary (color) filters:} Color filters are mostly used to enhance the color contrast differences between surface features on the moon or planets. The filters screw into a standard eyepiece barrel. The contrast differences are subtle and some observers report little or no observable differences. It may take patience and experience to recognize the differences.

{\color{blue} UHC} \quad Ultra High Contrast filter. Increases the contrast of planetary and emission nebulas.\\
{\color{blue} OIII} \quad Oxygen-III filter. Similar to UHC, but higher contrast on certain nebulas.\\
{\color{blue} H$\beta$} \quad Hydrogen Beta filter passes a particular colour of hydrogen light found in certain nebulas.\\
{\color{blue} Polariser} \quad Darkening the moon and enhancing contrast on the planets.\\
{\color{blue} IR pass} \quad Infrared pass filter is useful for getting steady views of the planets because IR is less disturbed by the atmosphere.\\
{\color{blue} Light pollution} \quad A filter to increase contrast of objects when observing from
urban areas. Darkens the sky by blocking street-lights whilst passing light from other colors.\\

\textbf{6. Finderscope}\\

Regardless of what kind of finder you are using you will have to align it with the telescope. The procedure is fairly simple and is best done during the day. The key thing is that you are aligning the finder to the telescope and not the other way around.\\

You want to do this during the day using a fixed land object. At night the things in the sky are moving which makes it more difficult to get the alignment correct.\\

During the day, set your telescope so that you can see a distant object, at least 1/4 mile away and farther is better. I prefer the cross arms on a telephone or power pole. That gives me a very well defined target right where the cross arm meets the pole. But the top of a chimney, a letter on a distant sign, or something similar can work as well. This is your alignment target\\

Here are the steps to follow.

\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em 
	\item Using your low power eyepiece point the telescope at the target and get it centered in the field of view of the eyepiece. Ignore the finder for now.
	\item Switch to a high power eyepiece and again, get that target centered
	\item Lock the scope into position in any way you can. You don’t want it to move
	\item Look through the finder and spot the target
	\item Using the adjustments on the finder bracket adjust the finder until the target is centered in the finderscope.
	\item Go back to the eyepiece and make sure the scope has not moved. The target should still be centered
	\item Check the finder again and make any final adjustments
\end{itemize}

When the finder and the telescope both are lined up on the same point on your target, you are all set and ready to take your telescope out under the stars.

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{finderscope.png}
	\caption{Left: Finderscope FOV and marking, Right: A typical finderscope.}
\end{figure}
\textbf{7. Telescope Mount}\\

There are two main types of telescope mount – equatorial and altitude-azimuth (``alt-az'')– with many variations.\\

\textit{Equatorial}: This type of mount has been popular, almost universal, since telescopes achieved any sort of useful size. As we have seen, the equatorial system of co-ordinates ($\alpha, \delta$) is based on the rotation of the Earth. A telescope with one axis aligned with the polar axis only needs to be driven around this axis at the sidereal rate to track astronomical objects.\\

\textit{Alt-az} mounts are the simplest telescope mounts. Advantages: Cheap and simple to operate.
Telescope moves up/down (altitude) and left/right
(azimuth). Reflecting telescopes using this mount are known as \textit{Dobsonians}. There are a couple of (minor) drawbacks to alt-az telescopes:\\

• The necessity for continuous rapid calculation of altitude and azimuth. This has been solved by the power of modern computers – so not really a problem at all.\\
• We have seen that the relationship between horizontal and equatorial co-ordinates can be expressed by two equations such as:
\[\sin a=\sin \delta \sin \phi+\cos \delta \cos \phi \cos H\]
and,
\[\sin A=-\frac{\sin H \sin \delta}{\cos a}\]

Note that, in the second equation, if the altitude (a) approaches $90^\circ$, the azimuth (A) approaches infinity. What this means, of course, is that for an object which passes through the zenith, as it does so, its azimuth jumps instantaneously from $90^\circ$ East to $90^\circ$ West (or from $90^\circ$ to $270^\circ$). In practice, it means that for objects near the zenith, it is very difficult to transform quickly enough and accurately enough from equatorial to horizontal co-ordinates and a small patch of sky near the zenith is effectively inaccessible, even though the telescope can easily point there. Simple observing program planning should avoid problems from this source.\\

\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{8. Field Rotation}\\

Alt-az mounts are to be avoided due to a phenomenon
known as field rotation. Field rotation occurs due to
the design of the alt-az mount. One axis, the azimuth
axis, rotates around a vertical line passing from the
center of the telescope to the zenith (left to right). The altitude axis rotates about a horizontal axis (up and down). Both axes must rotate at different rates to maintain the object in the field of view (FOV). As the Earth rotates about its axis, the central object in the field of view will remain centered but other objects in the FOV will appear to rotate with elapsed time. Field Rotation is an undesirable effect on time-exposure astrophotographs caused when an ``Alt-Az" (``altitude-azimuth" or alt-azimuth) mount (sometimes called a ``Dobsonian" or ``fork mount") is used to hold and point a telescope with a camera. It is also sometimes called Frame Rotation because the objects framed by the photograph seem to have rotated while the picture was taken.\\

Let the FOV of the telescope be represented by a square and follow the motion of Sagittarius as it rises in the east. Because the alt-az mount can only move around the azimuth axis and the up and down
on the altitude axis, the FOV remains fixed with the bottom parallel to the horizon. The objects in the sky, however, are rotating around the celestial pole star, Polaris. So asterisms and binary stars appear to rotate in the FOV. An equatorial mounted telescope does not suffer field rotation because the telescope is polar aligned and the FOV does not remain horizontal as it tracks; the telescope rotates. So the FOV matches the rotation of the object and it remains in the same fixed position.\\

\textbf{Mathematical Concepts Behind Field Rotation}
Stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west, rotating about the north celestial pole star, Polaris. Rising stars will reach their highest elevation in the sky as they cross the local meridian, due south of the line between Polaris and the zenith. The altitude indicates the vertical position of the star with $0^\circ$ at the horizon and $90^\circ$ at the zenith. From direct observation, the following aspects are known about rate of rotation
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The maximum rate of field rotation occurs as the star passes through the zenith.
	\item The rate of field rotation is minimal when a star passes through the prime vertical at the
	horizon.
	\item Considering the azimuth only, the rate of field rotation is highest when the star passes
	through 0° (N) and 180° (S), and lowest when
	the star passes through 90° (E) and 270° (W).
	\item Regarding latitude, field rotation is highest at the Earth’s equator and non-existent at the NCP and SCP.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
	\text{Rotation Rate}= \frac{\omega_\oplus \ast \cos(\text{Latitude}) \ast \cos(\text{Azimuth})}{\cos\text{(Altitude)}}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_\oplus=4.178 \times 10^{-3}$ degrees/second; Earth’s rotation. \\

If we only consider changing the values of the
azimuth in Equation 1, the least amount of field rotation (zero) is along the prime vertical (due east or west) because east is 90° from north ($\cos90^\circ=0$) and west is 270° from north ($\cos270^\circ=0$). Looking toward the other directions, the maximum rate of field rotation is when the star is due south (180° from north; $\cos180^\circ=1$) or directly north where $\cos0^\circ=1$.
\begin{gather*}
	\text{Least ROR}_{E,W}= \frac{\omega_\oplus \ast \cos(\text{Lat}) \ast 0}{\cos\text{(Alt)}}=0;\quad \text{(Az = 90 or 270)}\\
	\text{MAX ROR}_{N,S}= \frac{\omega_\oplus \ast \cos(\text{Lat}) \ast 1}{\cos\text{(Alt)}};\quad \text{(Az = 0 or 180)}
\end{gather*}

The altitude function deals with values between
the horizon (0°) and the zenith (90°), so only considering changes to the values of the altitude in Equation 1 and using the trig values given above we get to following.
\[\text{RoR}_{Horizon}= \frac{\omega_\oplus \ast \cos(\text{Latitude}) \ast \cos(\text{Azimuth})}{1}; \quad \text{Alt = 0}\]
so the rate depends solely on the latitude and azimuth.
\[	\text{RoR}_{Zenith}= \frac{\omega_\oplus \ast \cos(\text{Latitude}) \ast \cos(\text{Azimuth})}{0}; \quad \text{Alt = 90}\]
which is an undefined quantity and not allowed.

\textsc{\textbf{Practice QnA}}
\begin{enumerate}

	\begin{sol}
		- To track stars/to counter diurnal motion.
	\end{sol}
	
	\item\textbf{ What is the purpose of using a finderscope?}
	\begin{sol}
		- Find objects more easily due to larger FOV. Image is upside down and left-right inverted.
		Magnification: 6 $\times$ 30, or 8 $\times$ 50 typically.
	\end{sol}
	
	\item \textbf{When not in use, how should accessories (eyepieces, diagonals, binoculars, finderscopes, etc.) be stored?}
	\begin{sol}
		- Store in dry box/Ziploc bag to combat humidity, with foam/cushion to add stability and protection.
	\end{sol}
	
	\item \textbf{A Newtonian needs to be well collimated (i.e., mirrors
	aligned to one another) to produce a sharp image. If you have set up a Newtonian Reflector outdoors, how can you
	quickly test if it is out of collimation?}
	\begin{sol}
		Perform a star test (i.e. defocusing a star at high magnification to make the diffraction rings more visible, and then checking if the diffraction rings are aligned or off-center).
	\end{sol}
	\item \textbf{How do you polar‐align your telescope near the equator, where Polaris cannot be seen most of the time?}
	
	\begin{sol}
		- Use compass to find magnetic North for alignment of azimuthal axis, then adjust mount's elevation/altitude to Singapore’s latitude  (less accurate), or\\
		
		Drift alignment: observe North/South drift then adjust altitudinal axis, observe East/West (RA) drift then adjust azimuthal axis (more accurate).
	\end{sol}
	
	\item  \textbf{After assembling, if you can move the main optical tube easily, is the counter weight located at the correct or incorrect position? }
	\begin{sol}
		- Correct position. The counter weight should balance with the OT, so a little force should move it smoothly. 
	\end{sol}
	\item \textbf{Why do we need to align an equatorial telescope towards the North Celestial Pole / Polaris?}
	\begin{sol}
	- As stars revolve around Polaris every $23^h56^m$, we can use only one knob to trace the star easily.		
	\end{sol}
	
	\item \textbf{Given a telescope with an aperture of 100mm and a focal length of 1600mm, when a 1.25-inch eyepiece
	of focal length 40mm is used, what is the effective magnification?}
\begin{sol}
- Telescope magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the telescope by the focal
length of the eyepiece. So $\mathbf{40\times}$. Again too find the magnification, we can use
\[\text{Magnification}=\frac{\text{Aperture}\times \text{Focal Ratio}}{\text{Eye Piece Focal Length}}\]
\end{sol}

\item \textbf{You would like to maximise your view of the Pleiades star cluster ($110'$) in your eyepiece. Given the following details of your telescope, which eyepiece should you choose? (1 inch = 2.54cm)}\\
\textbf{Telescope: 5-inch aperture, f/6}\\

\begin{sol}
Let the eyepiece focal length be x mm and apparent field-of-view be $y^\circ$.
	
focal length = (aperture size) $\times$ (focal ratio) = $5 \times 2.54 \times 6 \times 10 = 762$ mm.

\begin{gather*}
	\text{magnification}=\frac{\text{focal length of telescope}}{\text{focal length of eyepiece}}=\frac{762}{x}\\
	\text{true field-of-view}=\frac{\text{apparent field-of-view}}{\text{magnification}}\times 60= \frac{y}{\text{magnification}}=\frac{60xy}{762}\; \rm arcminutes
\end{gather*}

Calculate for each option with the different values of $x$ and $y$. This gives 35 mm focal length, $40^\circ$ apparent field-of-view.
\end{sol}
\item \textbf{You brought out your club’s $6''$ F/6 Newtonian telescope to observe M6. With a quick search you realise M6 is 2$5'$ in angular diameter. Which eyepiece would you attach to the telescope to maximise your view of M6 while still ensuring the whole of M6 can be seen in the eyepiece?

\[\text{Magnification} =\frac{914.4}{x}\]
\begin{align*}
	\text{TFOV}=&\frac{\rm AFOV}{M}\\
	\text{TFOV [in arcmin]}=&\text{TFOV [in degrees]} \times 60\\
	>& 25'
\end{align*}

Option \textbf{D} matches the perfect condition.	
\end{sol}



\item \textbf{The Celestron C8 is a Schmidt-Cassegrain reflective telescope with a focal ratio of 10 and a diameter of 203.2 mm. Using an objective lens (eyepiece) with a focus of 25 mm, a circular squirrel with a diameter of 25 cm fills the field of view completely. Assuming an apparent field of view of $50^\circ$.}
\begin{sol}
The focal length of the telescope is 203.2 cm. Using the focal ratio, we can infer that the focus is ten times longer, i.e.
2032 mm.\\

Using, $\text{FoV} =\dfrac{50}{M}=50\times \dfrac{f_{oc}}{f_{ob}}=37'$.\\

The distance from the squirrel to the observer is 2328 cm. The distance can be obtaind using trigonometry. Specifically, $d=\dfrac{h}{\tan \alpha}$, where $\alpha = 50^\circ$.\\

The resolving power is $0.68''$ from $\theta =1.22\dfrac{\lambda}{D}$. \end{sol}

\item \textbf{The Celestron Advanced VX Y Go-To Reflector Telescope has an $Y''$ optical tube assembly with specification f/5, where Y is an unknown value. The focal length of the optical tube is 1016 mm. Two eyepieces, one with diameter 8 mm and another with diameter 25 mm were provided. Determine the minimum size of a crater on the Moon that can be resolved by this telescope. Assume light of wavelength 550 nm.}

\begin{sol}
The aperture diameter is determined by
\[D=\frac{f}{N}=\frac{1016}{5}= 203.2 \; \rm mm\]
Using the formula for the Rayleigh criterion $\theta =1.22\dfrac{\lambda}{D}$ with $\lambda= 550$ nm, $D = 203.2$ mm, we get that the minimum angle that can be resolved is $0.0001892^\circ$.\\

Using $s = r\theta$ and the Earth-Moon distance of $3.843\times 10^8$ m, we see that the minimum distance on the Moon that can be resolved is
\[s=5.843\times 10^8 \times  \frac{0.0001892}{360}\times 2\pi =1.27\; \rm km.\]

\textbf{\textit{Try Yourself}}
\begin{enumerate}[T1.]	
\item  Student A has just received a telescope from her professor. Her professor had performed some measurements on the telescope, and told her that it has an effective focal length of 1800mm, with an aperture of 90mm. Student A next chooses to use a 5 mm Plossl eyepiece, with an advertised apparent field of view (AFOV) of $40^\circ$.
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
	\item Calculate the f/ratio of this scope
	\item Calculate the resultant magnification that this setup provides
	\item Calculate the exit pupil of this setup.
	\item Calculate the true field of view (TFOV) for this setup.
	\item Is this setup good for deep sky astrophotography? Justify your answer.\\
	(Hint: Think about highest useful magnification. Also, an average dark adapted human eye has an entrance pupil of about 7mm)
\end{enumerate}

\item  Upon further investigation, Student A discovered that a 3X Barlow lens had been left in the telescope’s visual back. She thus removed the Barlow. She also changed the eyepiece to a 10mm Nagler, with an advertised $80^\circ$ wide-view AFOV.\\

Calculate the new effective focal length, f/ratio, magnification, exit pupil and TFOV.

diameter of the eyepiece field of view. Estimate the declination of the star. Assume the star is in the
northern hemisphere.

\item A curious astronomer has observed two stars while they have been passing across the very center of telescope’s field of view at the same time interval. One day, he noticed one of them rising and another setting simultaneously. Show that the stars will appear in exactly opposite directions on the horizon. Ignore any atmospheric effects.

\subsection{Astrophotography}
As the prices of DSLRs drop since their inception, more people now can take photographs of the night
sky. The art of Astrophotography has caught on to become a serious pastime for amateur astronomers.\\

\textsf{Photography Jargon}\\

Before we jump in, we should familiarise a little on some technical jargon that is commonly used in the
photography community. The ultimate goal of a photographer is to control the amount of light captured by the sensor when taking a photo. It cannot be too much light else the photo will come out overexposed (too bright). The converse is true too, when the camera does not capture enough light.
To achieve a good control over light, photographers concern themselves with 3 main settings:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Camera Settings}                                               & \textbf{What it Controls}                                                                                                   \\ \hline
		Shutter Speed / Exposure Length                                        & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}The length of time the sensor is exposed to light.\\ (e.g. 1/3s, 1/1000s, 1s, etc.)\end{tabular} \\ \hline
		\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}ISO \\ (pronounced ``eye-soh'')\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}The Sensitivity of the sensor.\\ Higher ISO = More Sensitive\end{tabular}                        \\ \hline
		f-Number/Ratio                                                         & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Aperture size of the lens.\\ Same definition with a telescope's f-ratio.\end{tabular}            \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
These three settings are what a photographer uses to control the amount of light that hits the sensor.\\
	
The last setting is known as the Zoom. It controls how magnified the image will be. It is usually expressed as the focal length of the lens. (e.g., 18mm, 35mm, 120mm etc.)

\subsection{Guessing the correct Magnitude}

Conditions for comparing sight according to the Pickering method:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em
	\item a small angular distance of the comparison star from the variable star;
	\item the spectral classes of the comparison star and variable star must be adjacent on the Harvard scale of spectral classes
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{IDEA} 1.]
	\itemsep0em 
	\item Choose 2 stars with known magnitudes of more or less the same brightness,
	\item  Divide the interval between them into 10 parts (or in the Neyland method - Blazhko into any number of parts, for example, into 5)
	\item Determine where the observed star is on the interval
	\item By linearizing the scale, you determine the magnitude
\end{enumerate}

\end{minipage}}
\end{center}



\subsection{How OBS Marking Works}

The observation/star chart round is all about {\color{red}PENALTIES}! You can lose more points due to silly mistakes than the ones you earn from correct answers. This happened to one student from Bangladesh in IOAA 2024. When answering or drawing on star charts, keep the following in mind:

\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{Tip} 1]
	\item \textsf{Answer exactly what is asked.} For example, if the question specifies that star names should be written in IAU designation only, do so. Avoid writing something like: Alpha Ori/Rigel. \\
	
	See the mistake? Instead of writing “$\alpha$ Ori/Betelgeuse,” I wrote *Rigel* this will result in \textbf{0 points}. TRUST me, these kinds of blunders happen more often than you’d think! Better to write only $\alpha$ Ori or Betelgeuse if you're sure about the answer.
	\item \textsf{Read the question carefully!} Words like \textit{within, in between, inside, and boundary} may have subtler meanings than you initially understand. For example in IOAA 24 the question was

\begin{pro}
	Consider that the angular distance between the stars Kraz (Beta Corvi) and Spica (Alpha Vir) is $17.2^\circ$.
	Using the Star Chart, draw the circumference and count which
	stars between magnitudes 4 and 6 exist \textbf{within} a radius of $8^\circ$ from Alpha Corvi.
\end{pro}
\begin{sol}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ioaa_24mag.png}
	\end{figure}
\end{sol}
	
{\color{red} Some students in IOAA24 marked all the stars between $4 \leq m \leq 6$ not only within the boundary but all over the map, loosing more points as penalty than earned!}	

\item \textsf{Observation accuracy in real/simulated sky.} Suppose you're asked to calculate RA/DEC/Mag of a star. The right answer and the marking scheme would look like this, 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Declination: $+69^\circ \, 09' \, 11''$
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item $<\pm 1.5' \implies 4$ points
		\item $\leq \pm 3' \implies 2$ points
		\item $>\pm 3' \implies 0$ points
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Right ascension: $9^h \, 55^m\, 54^s$
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item $<\pm 22.5\,s \implies 4$ points
		\item $\leq \pm 45\,s \implies 2$ points
		\item $>\pm 45\,s \implies 0$ points
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Magnitude: 10.2 mag
		\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item $<\pm 0.4\, \text{mag} \implies 2$ points
		\item $\leq \pm 0.8\, \text{mag} \implies 1$ points
		\item $>\pm 0.8\, \text{mag} \implies 0$ points
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

So you see, you need to precise within arcseconds/seconds not arcminutes or several minutes! Recommended answers typically lies within $\sim 5-10\%$ range. How to do that!? $\Rightarrow$ PRACTICE your senses and buildup intuition, observe the sky in real time! 
	
	\item \textsf{Be precise with locations in charts.} Most of the marks depend on your accuracy. Deviating too much from the correct position will result in penalties. Let me show you the boundaries for drawing equator, ecliptic and meridian line (IOAA 2024):  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{boundari_map.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{sol}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em 
	\item 4 points (1 point for each Cardinal Point)
	\item 6 points (2 points for each line)
\end{itemize}
\end{sol}
{\color{red} Each correct line drawing has full mark within the range, if you divert outside the recommended range some penalty ($\sim 50\%$) will be applied. Answer outside the range will result in 0 points.} 
\item \textsf{Work with printed maps!} Before IOAA be sure to create star maps of the host country for the duration of the event.
\end{enumerate}

From my experience as an amateur Astronomer and IOAA team leader for 5 years I came across these things student should be aware and mindful about. 
\subsubsection{2019}
On \nth{23} March, 2019, Mahmud and Fahim were observing their local sky with their IAU100 Bresser Telescope. According to their observation Mahmud made a sky map using “Your Sky” website. Now you’ve to find few things according to their map--

    \item Draw a circle for the Circumpolar star region. [A circumpolar star is a star, as viewed from a given latitude on Earth, that never sets below the horizon due to its apparent proximity to one of the celestial poles.]
    \item If the Field of View (FOV) of this map is $80^\circ$, find the angular distance from $\alpha$ Cassiopeia to $\alpha$ Ursa Minor. [Hint: the line passes through the center of the eyepiece of the Telescope)
    \item Prove that if the right ascension of a star is equal to its altitude from one point/place then the magnitude of its longitude and declination is also equal from that point/place.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{2016}

The skymap below [Figure \ref{INAO16}] corresponds to sky above Nagpur ($21^\circ$ N, $79^\circ$ E) at 09:00 am on \nth{1} February 2014. If you are not used to using sky maps, it is important to note that sky map is usually seen lying down on the ground (feet to the South), facing the sky with map in your hand. Thus, East is on the left of the map and West is on the right. Answer the following questions:\\

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Mark Polaris with letter ‘\textbf{P}’.
    \item Circumpolar stars for a given place are the stars, which will never go below the horizon. Draw boundary of this region and mark it by the letter ‘\textbf{C}’.
    \item The celestial equator is just a projection of the Earth’s equator in the sky. It will be the locus of points which are equidistant from the north and the south pole. Draw the equator on the map approximately and mark it with ‘\textbf{Q}’.
    \item The ecliptic is the imaginary yearly path of the Sun in the sky. Mark this approximately on the map and mark it with ‘\textbf{E}’.
    \item Mark approximate position of the Sun on the map as ‘\textbf{S}’.
    \item Yesterday was a new moon day. Mark the current position of the moon on the map as ‘\textbf{M}’.
    \item Which star was very close to the Zenith at 06:00 am today? Mark it on the map as ‘\textbf{N}’.
    \item Draw a line across sky showing horizon line as at 07:00 am today as ‘\textbf{H}’.

\end{enumerate}

Refer to the Map \ref{IOAA16_OM} for these problems\footnote{The digital copy of this map isn't available anywhere else. But fortunately I was a participant of IOAA-16 myself and I have my own script still now [2022!]. So I used my own work from IOAA and edited this image!}. 

\subsubsection{Observational Planetarium}

\textbf{OP1:} Eight well known historical supernovae will appear in the projected sky one at a time (not necessarily in chronological order). You have to identify the appropriate map (Map 1 / Map 2) where a particular supernova belongs and mark it in the corresponding map with ‘+’ sign and write codes ‘S1’ to ‘S8’ besides it.\\
