# Star Maps 101 and Practices

**Star Maps 101 and Practices** is a notebook/guide which I made for preparation of *International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics*. This contains detailed description of Star Map/Chart analysis as well as bit introduction to Astronomical Observations practically. I am currently working on improving Telescopic observations part. Please don't use the notes for monetary gain.
