**Star Maps 101 and Practices** is a notebook/guide that I made in preparation for *the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics*. This contains a detailed description of Star Map/Chart analysis as well as a brief introduction to Astronomical Observations practically. This book is used in the training of the Bangladesh team at the [Bangladesh Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://bdoaa.org). 

## Introduction

I started this book immediately after my Olympiad experience in 2016. However, as I joined Graduate school and my academics took precedence, I could not fully devote my time and resources to the book. As a result, I have not been able to cover all the topics I had set out to cover. I am currently working on improving the Telescopic observations part and am willing to add detailed notes on the Celestial Coordinate System. Hence, I would like to request that all Astronomy enthusiasts contribute to extending this book and making it more complete. **It seems that due to the file size, I won't be able to update this book anymore.** 

## How to contribute?

This book has been written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and published via GitHub, hence a working knowledge of TeX and git is expected. The best way to contribute to this repository is by following these steps:

- Fork this repository.
- Make changes in a separate branch.
- Create a pull request with an adequate description of changes.

For interested contributors who are not familiar with these terms, the QGIS-documentation repo explains these steps in detail for people making their [first contribution](https://github.com/gitty-coder/QGIS-Documentation/blob/master/docs/documentation_guidelines/first_contribution.rst).
